		                            <p>There was something in the air that September morning. It had rained heavily last night. The air was mildly cool and songs of the cuckoo made it the peaceful it can get. And now, the smell of wet soil exuding into the surroundings, created a sort of hallucination that calms you down. Sitting in our sixth floor hostel room’s balcony, watching over the university campus slowly giving in to the warmth of the rising sun, we hatched a plan to trek Nag-tibba.
		<br>
		<br>There is something about the persuasion of the nature itself; it was the weather that morning more than anything else that instilled in us a desire to get the more of it. And Nag-tibba, being our tried and tested haven, was the perfect location we could go to this weekend. It’s a peak in the lower Himalayas at an altitude of around 3,100 meters(highest peak in shiwaliks range) whose upper half is covered with dense virgin forests. And the first time I went there; I knew I would be back for more.
		<br>
		<br>However, we embarked upon our journey from Roorkee bus stand next morning at around 4000 hrs with nothing but a mere cash of 5,000 and a few blankets apart from a water bottle. We boarded the bus to Dehradun and reached there around 6015 hrs. The bus for Mussourie was for 2 hours late so we hired a taxi. But since we were only three persons, we needed another one to share the fare with us, in order to save money. All of us went berserk over the bus stand looking for someone going to Mussourie, that too by a taxi. Maybe the town was in mood to help and we found just the right person, a student who lived in Mussourie.
		<br>
		<br>So we were en-route Mussourie, passing from the remains of once naturally beautiful Doon. But now it looked like an ugly version of some metro city. New buildings sprouting here and there, receding greenery, cement everywhere. Human hands, trying to improve something, which the master had itself taken care of.  And what is the result of such endeavors, ugliness.
		<br>
		<br>“Development is happening.” Said the taxi driver quite sarcastically, who happened to be a sardar. “Sab lichi ke ped kaat diye in logon ne, nahi toh ye road bhari hoti thi unse. Jab se capital bana hai,   kuch khubsurti bachi hi nahin yahan par.”
		<br>
		<br>Though we felt bad for Dehra, but we were still hopeful of finding our untouched refuge in deeper Himalayas. Come Mussourie, it was around 0800 and the city was already bustling with tourists, mimicking their habits from the life below. The “Queen of the Hills” is what this city is popularly known as; and with the incessant honking and chaos all around, one can definitely say that the peace of her highness was not disturbed but brutally murdered.
		<br>
		<br>However, we came to know that we just missed the bus to the village ‘Nain-Bagh’, a connecting point to Nagtibba. We were to wait for 2 more hours before there’ll be another bus, and Her Highness lay bare before us to be explored. But we didn’t budge, and chose to wait at the bus stand instead. Our main goal was Nag-Tibba. We strolled around the market a bit, and then finally boarded the bus.
		<br>
		<br>The bus journey in itself was a roller-coaster ride. The driver negotiated many sharp turns without finding any reason to slow down during the process. We passed Campty-falls on the way. Another tourist hot-spot with hordes of taxis all around. All honking and traffic, people shouting and making noises for no other reason than to intimidate each other. “Ah…cried the queen.” We moved on.
		<br>
		<br>After an hour long journey the bus reached our interlink ‘Nain-Bagh’. A small village around 40 kms from Mussourie. We were hungry and treated ourselves to many things the market had to offer, be it parathas, maggi or fish-rice. From ‘Nain-bagh’ it was a 20 minute journey to ‘Panth-vari’, the base for starting the trek. If Nain-bagh was quiet, Panth-vari was quieter. A single road connected all the oddly made isolated houses on the hill, with a few shops at the starting. When we reached there only a single shop was open, so we didn’t have much to choose. And to our luck, like most of the shops in remote locations, this one too served all the purposes. We had tea and packed our dinner of chapatis and fried vegetables. We found our guide in the shop itself, who offered his services for 2000 rupees.
		<br>
		<br>We started the trek from Panth-vari at about 1400 hrs, passing through the village. Within minutes one could feel the hardship of walking uphill. Muscles of my thighs and back were the most stressed and we had to rest after every 20-25 minutes. The trek from Panth-Vari has two landmarks on the way, two natural water falls. As there is no other source of water, we anxiously waited to reach the first waterfall as our water supply got over. We reached there after an hour or so. One can hear the sound of the descending water as one gets nearer. A thin stream of water flowing down gently from above, with water so cold that you can’t drink it at once. Surrounded by trees everywhere and deeply silent environs, it felt extremely relaxing just to sit there. nevertheless, we rested for about 15 minutes or so and moved on.
		<br>
		<br>After the first waterfall the trek got more tougher with steep slopes and the land covered with sandstones. One could slip easily if not much attention is being paid. But as we got higher the reward was proportional to the physical exhaustion. From this point the valley was not visible but huge green hills all around, mingling with clouds which seemed to be moving slowly. Air was becoming more cooler, more peaceful. There was something musical about the sounds it made. Though we were tired but were not feeling so. Our guide was walking way faster than us and had to wait for us time and again.
		<br>
		<br>We passed few rudimentary settlements made of mud on the way. Perhaps of a few villagers who chose to live a bit higher. And then came the second waterfall. Well this actually was tampered with, a pipe channeling the water into a pit. But nevertheless, it was a blessing. And now we had completed about half of the trek. From this point we could see the dense forest that lie ahead. Many times before have I heard about the virgin forests of the himalayas, and now, I was standing right in front of them.
		<br>
		<br>The excitement was at it’s peak as we started towards the other half of the journey. It was about 1600 hrs. For a few hundred metres the slope was quite steep and it was difficult to climb. But after that the path was relatively easy.
		<br>
		<br>We enquired our guide about the wildlife, if there ever was, to be seen in this area. And to our surprise he mentioned frequent incidents of Asiatic black bear and foxes being spotted in these hills. And sometimes even leopards can come in search of the grazing sheeps and goats. As we climbed further the forest was getting thick and sunlight was eluding us time and again. The sun was in its due course to set. And a kilometre or so of the trek was left to be completed. We didn’t had any torch and our mobile batteries were almost dead. There was nothing to guide us in the darkness and for the first time I felt scared. The path ahead was not clearly visible, and the shade of the trees made it more darker than it could get. This situation must have been for 20 minutes.
		<br>
		<br>As we were about to lose hope of making it to the top something miraculous happened. We reached an area where the trees were seldom and a black coloured sky with millions of small twinkling white dots above us. Moon was shining like a blessing. It was the most beautiful night sky I had ever seen. It was then I realised that we were on top. All of a sudden the pain vanished and was replaced by a certain sense of accomplishment.

Well, the first time I heard about this place I had a perception that it might be one of those rugged mountainous treks but the entire trail is damn beautiful and keep you entertained throughout the time.” - Menka Bhatt. THRILLOPHILIA</blockquote>
		                            <p>The top of the mountain is a vast greenland with a defunct forest guest house in the middle. It offers an uninterrupted view of the sky, as far as you can see. It’s as if the boundaries between the earth and the sky are blurred at this place. A truly magical experience for an inhabitant of the plains. This is it, I thought. This is definitely the place where the gods must live. No wonder they call this place Dev-Bhoomi i.e The land of the gods. One can see a red flag nearby of the temple of Naag Devta (The Serpent God). 
		<br>
		<br>There was a hut a little downhill on the other side of the mountain, where nomads lived. They were a family of four, with two kids and a few goats. There dwelling was as simple as it could be. A hut made out of mud and wood, and stacks of hay placed here and there creating a certain harmony in the whole structure. They were very simple people and received us warmly. They gave us blankets as it were to get very cold during the night. They also reheated our food and offered us tea made of goat milk. 
		<br>
		<br>After the dinner we again went back to the forest rest house, a torn and tattered shelter. It had 3-4 rooms inside without any door. We rested in the first and the outermost and lit up a bonfire. Names of many people were written on the wall, and some even took the pain to write testimonies, that too with coal! But we had nothing to write, we were too overwhelmed by the himalayas that there were no words at that moment. The blankets proved useful as the mountain wrapped itself up in a shroud of bone chilling cold as the night advanced. 
		<br>
		<br>In the morning we visited the temple, which is a must, advised our guide.According to the locals, It brings good luck and ensures safe journey, and chances are that you won’t die of a snake bite.(conditions apply!) The temple was very ancient, and it was being reconstructed. But the work was being done only in summer months as it becomes more difficult in winters. 
		<br>
		<br>After wandering and exploring for an hour or so, we came across the nomads who again offered us tea. During the time we also played little games with their cute kids. After the tea, we returned their blankets and asked them how much should we pay them. And to our surprise the man was confused and looked at our guide. He spoke something to him in the vernacular and the guy nodded. Our guide told us that he will accept any amount, only if we wanted to give him. Impressed by his generosity, though a little tight on budget, we gave him 200 rupees which he gladly accepted. 
		<br>
		<br>Now we started downhill and reached Panth-Vari within 3 hours. We took a taxi direct to Dehradun, and boarded the bus back to Roorkee. Though the journey was over but all of us carried a piece of the mountain within us. Our share of the natúre’s bounty, a share of peace, a share of blissfulness, a share of happiness, a share of the mighty Himalayas.</p>
